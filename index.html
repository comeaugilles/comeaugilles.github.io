                <h2 class="page-header">Our Motivation</h2>
                <p>Every year, commonly available medication is withdrawn from the market due to safety concerns.
                From the market withdrawal of Thalidomide (a sedative causing foetal malformation) in the early 60s, to the withdrawal of Vioxx (a painkiller causing heart-attacks and strokes, marketed for 5 years) in the mid 00s, the need for withdrawal of marketed medication constitutes an important health hazard.</p>
                <p>In order to gain marketing authorization for clinically approved medical products, pharmaceutical companies should demonstrate the capability to gather post-marketing reports of side effects through local country offices and telephone hotlines. With the widespread use of social media, the tendency to report side effects to the general public has risen tremendously.</p>
                <p>So we started to wonder: what if we have tons of social media posts and data, and we run some data analysis ... could we get some new side effects that the pharmaceuticals aren't aware of ?</p>

                <h2 class="page-header">Diving into Data</h2>
                <p>We had some awesome data to use:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Postings from Online Media about our chosen pharmaceuticals</li>
                    <li>Pharmaceuticals with past investigations</li>
                    <li>And a list of known adverse effects</li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                <p>And our data came from all over the world ...</p>
                <img src="images/worldmap_posts.png" alt="" />
                <br />
                <p>So the question was: which drugs should we investigate?. Well, we took the top 300 drugs named on postings having the words "adverse effects" or "side effects" in their post. After having a look at them we came up with our very own top 22:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MYRBETRIQ</li>
                    <li>PROPRANOLOL</li>
                    <li>EFFEXOR</li>
                    <li>ZOCOR</li>
                    <li>BENICAR</li>
                    <li>LEVAQUIN</li>
                    <li><strong>XARELTO</strong></li>
                    <li>MIRENA</li>
                    <li>OLANZAPINE</li>
                    <li>HARVONI</li>
                    <li>TRAZODONE</li>
                    <li>WELLBUTRIN</li>
                    <li>INVOKANA</li>
                    <li>RISPERIDONE</li>
                    <li>CELEXA</li>
                    <li>LEXAPRO</li>
                    <li>FINASTERIDE</li>
                    <li>ELIQUIS</li>
                    <li>FLUOXETINE</li>
                    <li>PREDNISONE</li>
                    <li><strong>RISPERDAL</strong></li>
                    <li>NAPROXEN</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As you can see, it's a short list, and in it we have highlighted 2 drugs. Bear them in mind for a little while, we will shortly talk about them.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <h2 class="page-header">Data Analysis: making sense of all the data we got!</h2>
                <p>We used 2 techniques for our analysis: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Word Categorization (LDA)</li>
                    <li>Comparing listed effects vs reported effects (Lexical approach)</li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                <p><strong>Word Categorization (LDA)</strong></p>
                 <p>In our first approach, we tried to see if we could dig into social media data and find what were the most common side effects for a group of specifics drugs. </p>
                <div class="text-center"><img src="images/mirena_mitro.png" alt="" width="400"/></div>
                <br>
                 <p>Sadly, this approach had limited success, so we did a little literature review about it and we found that there were 3 major articles published about side effects, and they used different techniques:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Lexicon-method</li>
                    <li>machine learning</li>
                    <li>association rule mining</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So as you can see, neither of them used LDA for this kind of investigation, and we believe that detection of side effects from social media is a young branch of data science, and sometimes when you try something new you won't get the best answer right away.</p>
                <br />
                <p><strong>Comparing listed effects vs reported effects</strong></p>
                <p>Now, after doing Word Categorization, we started to compare our listed side effects from FDA and other pharmaceutical associations and what we found in social media posts</p>
                <p>We didn't have the time to do each of the 22 drugs listed before, so we picked 2:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Xarelto</li>
                    <li>Risperdal</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Xarelto</strong></p>
                <p>Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is an anticoagulant (blood thinner) that prevents the formation of blood clots. Xarelto is used to prevent or treat a type of blood clot called deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to blood clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism). A DVT can occur after certain types of surgery.</p>
                <div class="text-center"><img src="images/xarelto.jpg" alt="" width="250"/></div>

                <p><strong>Risperdal</strong></p>
                <p>Risperdal is used to treat schizophrenia and symptoms of bipolar disorder (manic depression). Risperdal is also used in autistic children to treat symptoms of irritability.
                Risperdal has been in the news quite a bit because of some fraudulent activity and fines received by Jansen in what and how Risperdal was prescribed by US doctors.</p>
                <div class="text-center"><img src="images/risperdal.png" alt="" width="250"/></div>

                <p>With these two drugs, we proceed to analize all their social media effects and cross it with all known side effects. Then we ran a validation test to see if our findings were significant, from a statistical point of view.</p>
                <p>So let's move to our results ...</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <h2 class="page-header">Results</h2>
                <h4><strong>1. Word Categorization (LDA)</strong></h4>
                <p>Our Latent Dirichlet Allocation Analysis demonstrated that LDA is effective at summarizing side effect topics, but not well suited for finding side effect terms. Topics generated by LDA were too unfocused. However, upon advice from our TF we chose a data subset and managed to generate an LDA prediction which resulted in the discovery of one unlabeled side effect: Endometriosis reported for Mirena.</p>
                <p>The limited success using LDA as our algorithm was put into perspective by a literature review : of the 3 prevaling schools of thought in the "Pharmacovigilance from social media"-domain, none employ LDA as their choice of algorithm.</p>
                <br />
                <h4><strong>2. Comparing listed effects vs reported effects (Lexical approach)</strong></h4>
                <p>The lexical approach is broken into two questions, and was performed against Xarelto and Risperdal, two of the 20 drugs we were evaluating:</p>
                <br />
                <p><strong>Validating Labeled Side Effects:</strong></p> 
                <p>Our method for validating labeled side effects was quite successful. We measured our approach using "Recall" method as the goal was to find whether people were talking about a high proportion of the known side effects on social media. If this wasn't the case, then the dataset would not be useful for trying to predict unlabeled side effects. Our Recall measures for Risperdal and Xarelto respectively were .962 and .935 respectively. From this analysis, we feel confident that people are indeed talking about key side effects of these pharmaceuticals in online and social media.</p>
                <p><strong>Identifying Unlabeled Side Effects:</strong></p> 
                <p>The next question was to determine whether we can predict new unlabeled side effects. Applying our term colocation techniques against the corpus, we uncovered a small list of unlabelled side effects. Given the amount of scrutiny of these two pharmaceuticals, this was an acceptable results - we expect that newer pharmaceutials would produce a bigger list.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>For Risperdal, we found some interesting side effects that were not listed on Drugs.com side effects. In particular, obesity, arthritis and hair loss. The most interesting of these was arthritis, which we found written up in a medical journal as well: <a href="http://www.ehealthme.com/ds/risperdal/arthritis">http://www.ehealthme.com/ds/risperdal/arthritis</a>. We also found a medical journal citing hair loss in all anti-psychotic medications, like Risperdal: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10798824">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10798824</a> We evaluated these effects by using a Fisher Exact tests and very low P-values for each, which makes us believe that these are not simply random anomalies.</li>
                    <li>For Xarelto, we found unlabeled side effects related to liver problems, and also hair loss. These effects were not listed on drugs.com, however we found this topic being discussed on site: <a href="http://livertox.nih.gov/Rivaroxaban.htm">http://livertox.nih.gov/Rivaroxaban.htm</a>. For hair loss, we found that discussed on a Xarelto lawsuit page: <a href="https://www.xareltocares.com/xarelto-a-truly-dangerous-medication/may-xarelto-cause-hair-loss-and-dry-skin-conditions/">https://www.xareltocares.com/xarelto-a-truly-dangerous-medication/may-xarelto-cause-hair-loss-and-dry-skin-conditions/</a> Again, these results were evaluated by a Fishers Exact test, with very low p-values as the result.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Additional Research</strong>: This research is a starting point, but is showing positive results for validating and discovering adverse effects. Further research directions which were prohibitive from barriers both in time and computing power were to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Run the entire list of drugs, or in fact all drugs through this process. This would require access to all of the social media data for these drugs however, as well as cluster of processing computers.</li>
                    <li>Clean up the lists of adverse effects, and group them for both what part of the body they effect, but also for synonyms. Our results would have been improved by having a cleaned list, but the list includes 31,000 effects and this should be undertaken by people with excellent domain knowledge.</li>
                    <li>Our methods uncover the postings mentioning adverse effects, there is an additional manual effort required to review all of the postings to further validate the conclusions.</li>
